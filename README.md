## DFHG Volumen Tertium

This repository stores data from the [DFHG project](http://www.dfhg-project.org/) - [Volumen Tertium](http://www.dfhg-project.org/DFHG/index.php?volume=Volumen%20tertium).

The volume contains fragments of 134 authors from the beginning of the reign of Ptolemy III in 247 BC through the beginning of the reign of Constantine the Great in 306 CE.

`xml` files have been automatically generated from data stored in the DFHG database and are encoded in accordance with the CTS/CITE Architecture.
The repository contains two kinds of files arranged by DFHG authors:
* Epidoc `xml` files that are encoded in accordance with EpiDoc standards and represent the structure of the edition of the FHG.
* Well formed `xml` files that collect information about fragments and extant texts collected in the FHG.
